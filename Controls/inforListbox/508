-cannot tab into it (fixed?)
-aria label? clicking the label didn't focus.
-add aria-selected to selected items? (is selected color correct?)
-check keys with the documents
	- down and up arrow should navigate not select (not an issue)
	- space to select
	- how to unselect
	
Recommendation
-change page (list box should not be used for single select)
