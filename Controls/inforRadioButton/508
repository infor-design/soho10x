Copy:
- enforce Use a label on radio buttons
- i think we need to just say you need the label
- my markup my be a little off (need to use a field set) 

Avoid:
Radio buttons are not supported consistently by all versions of browsers, screen readers, and combinations. 
A correctly labeled and tagged set of radio buttons is a very difficult control for users of screen-reading technology. 
If a "choose only one" situation is called for, a select menu is preferable.

If you must use radio buttons, remember to label them with the "Label for" tag. When radio buttons are used, each radio button in the group has the shared name, 
but a unique ID. Each radio button in the group has a unique label, as well. 

Questions:

For top level label what do i do? Span ok?
If its just a simple radio button does it help to have aria?
Error: Only elements with role=radio or role=presentation are allowed as children of an element with role=radiogroup. (on the labels)
