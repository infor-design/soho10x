Recommendation
	- click on the labels to focus the field tip
	- dyslexic fonts.com - ability to set font /fontsize (and colors)
	- provide contrast settings
	- readability plugin chrome
	- avoid keyboard traps
	- make sure labels are associated
	- make sure that it works at 200%  with screen magnifier (use title attribute for zoom users?) 
	- Dont use links as labels
	- labels need to include data format
	- avoid reading : or > or < (implementation)
	- Abbreviations like W.O. can use on screen text.
