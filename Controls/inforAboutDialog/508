-Added Aria Tags and Made it pass Wave

ToDo:
-Focus the text field first
-Keyboard issue seems to be closing the dialog
-Start about dialog -> end about dialog
-Contain the focus
-Focus back to the calling button.
-H elements?
-Rest of content (display hidden)
-Focus on the Title (so it reads) then next tab down (Q)
-Aria-Hidden = true (code sample) (keep the )
-Change the text area to a p tag.

Questions:
- When going to text-only version the textareas just says text area? Is this a problem
	- Test that it reads it on the keyboard
- Focus on the Title (so it reads) then next tab down (Q)
- How to handle Invisible fields and buttons (focus field is part of the dialog).
