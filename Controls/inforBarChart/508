- Needs a text description of the chart
- SVG
	http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/access.html
- Think about color blind users
	- use different hashing or marks
	- show as a table as well for color blind user.
	- blue and yellow are the safest...
	
- If its not used by some users state that in docs (like sharepoint admin)
- Provide another way to input this.
- Svg vs Canvas?
- need to use hashing patterns for charts
- when we tab into a chart pop out the alt text for keyboard users
- Charts with alt text and tables
	or show a Link to html table
- For org chart see if you can use ol and li markup

TODO
	- Hidden Table - use the title with the Last 3 Months.
	- Link to the table (that pops up)
	- aria-label
	- alt text
