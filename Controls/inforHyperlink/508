Guidelines
	- Question: Always have an underline so that it also communicates its a link
	- Title is not read by AT.
		- so if title is not clear use off screen text
	- Links need to make sense in context and no duplicate links and the link text makes sense
		Example: Instead of Click her to reset password (underline on click here) 
			Do: reset password (underline this)
	- Make sure two links with same name go to same place.
	- Course details example (use off-screen text slide in accessibility basics.)
