- Same comments as accordian
- Use aria-expanded 
- Make sure the field set doesnt have the same name as the field? 
- Make sure you use fieldset markup when needed (heading vs legend) - heading default
	- if both use aria-described by
- aria-hidden is redundent

Recommendation
-Use field set if you have more than one field with the same name on the field to group
