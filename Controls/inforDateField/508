- use the input masking like the time field
- need format masking info in the label
- blind user would like to know the day of the week (add it to a span?)
- add aria-has-popup
- contrast issue on disabled days
- role="list" and role="listitem" (li) for the tree and aria-level
- be more forgiving in the date format

- funky keyboard behaviour
	- when keying around then update the date in the field

-quick dates is not keyboard accessible
	- add a second button or keyboard shortcut
- go to next year (ctrl+pgup / ctrl+pgdown) (need an override)
- use new keyboard short cuts
-magnifyer issues (make calendar come underneath)

Recommendation
-use like the separate time field and read the alt text
-constraints should be mentioned in the label (or use aria-described by)

Question?
-should alt down arrow or enter trigger?
-invalid date is cleared should this be announced.
