- Contrast 
	- what about adding : text-shadow: 0 0 1px rgba(34, 34, 34, 0.3);
	- only works in ie10 so make this in the conformance claim. (add to wiki)
	- Title on a label?

Todo:
	- don't need aria-disabled if its is disabled
	- don't need disabled="false" just disabled
	- Adjust color for disabled form button

Recommendation
	- Using the hand is good.
	- make another color version?
	
Question
	- is the text shadow cool?
